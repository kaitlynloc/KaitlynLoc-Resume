        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Kaitlyn Loc and I am a second year student currently studying Psychology in the University of California, Riverside. I am looking to obtain an internship in your marketing field. I have experience with a variety of people ranging from children to adults. I've worked several part time jobs in the food industry which has given me experience with being organized, efficient, friendly, and professional. Iâ€™ve been able to keep calm under pressure and have learned to talk to unsatisfied customers. Multiple part time jobs has also taught me to be punctual and has taught me to communicate with upper management about scheduling conflicts and conflicts with other workers in general. I had only myself to rely on when working and Iâ€™ve figured out that relying on others is not very efficient in the workforce nor is it fair to others. Putting the responsibilities on someone else may also affect your relationship with that worker and it may affect the workspace as well. I believe that have a positive workspace is one of the most important factors when coming into a new job, this being because if the workers are miserable then they are less inclined to continue to work and they may spread bad rumors about how the company treats their employees; however, having a positive and supportive work environment encourages employees to work at that company for longer periods of time which would also positively reflect the company because more people are staying and their workers are doing well. I believe that I can contribute to having a positive and productive work environment given the amount of people Iâ€™ve interacted with. Changing my personality to match others is something that I have been complimented on and something that not a lot of people can do. I strongly believe that it is vital to a workspace especially in marketing because marketing teams need to be able to appeal to the public and get the people to be interested in the products. I also worked two jobs at once while also taking three classes, so I had to force myself to manage my time wisely. I also wanted to make sure I had enough time to spend with my friends and family so I made sure that the times i wasnâ€™t working and wasnâ€™t in school, I was checking up on them to make sure they were doing okay. I also strongly believe that people should have a good support system whether they be friends or family. Maintaining a good and healthy relationship with the people you love and care for should be also one of my top priorities because without the support of others I do not think Iâ€™d be able to get very far. They inspire me to do better everyday and they make sure that I do not push myself to a breaking point.
<br><br>

        A hobby that Iâ€™ve picked up is photography but more recently, in addition to photography, I started printing out the photos Iâ€™ve taken. The photos remind me of the happiest moments in my life and I always try my best to at least take a few photos everyday just to remind myself that everyday is a good day. As most do, I have days where I am not the happiest and days where I am overwhelmed and want to quit, however, looking at the photos Iâ€™ve taken of the people Iâ€™m with and the people that make me happy, remind me that there is no reason for me to give up. Iâ€™ve also started taping up the photos that Iâ€™ve printed in a place that is easily accessible so that I can see them everyday and so that I can start everyday positively. Since doing so, I havenâ€™t had as many bad days and I think it is a good habit to get into. I think that pasting up photos that make you happy should be something that others incorporate into their lives as well because it can remind them of loved ones and of the times they were at their happiest. This could also contribute to the positive work environment that I mentioned earlier. Being happy, although others can help, does start with the person themselves. If they are able to go into work happy and with a positive attitude it affects their coworkers and shows them that there is no reason to be miserable at work. And working in an environment that has consistently happy and positive workers also reflects the companyâ€™s image. If a company were to be infamous for having miserable employees then no one would apply there and the company may fall, however working in a company that is known to take care of their workers would encourage more people to apply there which could potentially make that company more successful and exclusive allowing them to raise the workers pay. In my opinion, everything starts with the mindset of the employees. From there it is a domino effect with the employees health, then the companyâ€™s success rate, then it comes full circle again back to the positive workspace. Being able to contribute to a positive work environment is something that I aspire to do since I have been working on myself my whole life. Being able to finally find a way to start my days happy and starting my days on good notes make me want to work in a company that values their employees well-being. Although it sounds bad, the only way to find a company that values workers is through the words of others. Having good rumors out is also good marketing because then it means that the product or the company is good enough for people to be talking about which also makes the product or company more desirable. The more desirable, the more they make, and the more they make the more famous the company is. 

<br><br>

        As a lot of others are, my goal in life is to work in a big company that treats their workers nicely. Not just with the benefits, but a company that cares about the wellbeings of their workers. One that allows their employees to miss a few days when theyâ€™re sick or when theyâ€™re mental health is declining. I am aware that a lot of companies do this, but a lot of employees feel pressured to stay at work when theyâ€™re sick or when theyâ€™re struggling because they think that management will call them lazy or think that they just donâ€™t want to work. I would also like to get into marketing because, from what I have heard, itâ€™s a good field that allows you to socialize with others and you have to find ways to appeal to the public. With my history of club positions and part time jobs, I believe that my ability to change my personality to appeal to others would pair well with marketing because I want to be able to build connections with others while also being able to make a living. Living off of the fact that I am social makes marketing even more appealing to me because I still love the idea of being able to meet different kinds of people as a job and being able to show others about something they may not have known about seems like a very good opportunity to utilize my social skills. I have spent a majority of my life perfecting and utilizing my social skills, and even though it may not appeal to everyone, I would love to work even harder to try to include everyone. I would not want others to feel left out nor would I want them to feel like they do not belong in the setting whether it was their job or not. If they felt like they did not belong I would show them that they do or try my best to introduce them to others that could potentially help them with their confidence levels. Everyone deserves the feeling of confidence and deserves to feel like their work is being appreciated. Marketing, to my understanding, can be disheartening sometimes when ideas are shot down or when your presence is ignored, but being able to appeal to more people gives me the chance to use what i have been doing my whole life.
